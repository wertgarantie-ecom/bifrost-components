# Component-Loader
The component loader is the central entry point for each component and is therefore needed on each page that holds one of the components listed above. This script is initialized with all neccessary data. It then loads the backend configuration, the component-scripts, CSS and insurance data and renders the component in the provided ```placeholder-div```. The component-loader uses the ```type="module"```-Flag for ES6-Modules. Please note: Web-Components are not supported by older browsers (for reference check [Custom-Elements](https://caniuse.com/es6-module) and [ES6-Modules](https://caniuse.com/es6-module)!  

This approach has several advantages: 
* The shop-integration is simplified because the integration is almost identical across all components
* CSS-Loading is done by us.
* Component-Scrypt-Loading and Versioning is done by us
* We can roll-out new features, new insurance products, hotfixes etc. without any extra effort on your side (though of course any new features or products will be discussed with the partner-shop beforehand) 
* We have an overview over all versions used across all shops and can therefore keep them up-to-date and stable

## Basic implementation
The component-loader has to be provided with all neccessary data for the current component. This data varies through the components and will therefore be described in the integration of the components itself. Two properties however are needed on all configs:

| Property | Type     | Description
| -------- | -------- | --------
| id       | ```string```   | PublicId for the current environment / stage
| stage    | ```string```   | The current environment, either ```staging``` or ```production```

### Example
```js
<script type="module">
    import initInsuranceComponents from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wertgarantie-component-loader@1/dist/wertgarantieLoader.min.js';

    const shopConfig = {
        id: "public:855wd6ea-rvre-a89z-9f8d-778f0ad9137f", 
        stage: "staging",
        
        ðŸ”¸ plus other data depending on component ðŸ”¸
    };
    
    initInsuranceComponents(shopConfig);
</script>
```



## Device Classes
In this short paragraph we will take a look at ```deviceClasses```. Device classes are passed as a property to product data within the loader-configuration as you will see in the following sections. 

Device classes are our way to identify insurable products. These are customizable to fit the partner shops internal data. 

For example: An electronics shops  sells smartphones and TVs which are related to different insurance products. All smartphone products will then have ```deviceClasses: "smartphone"``` while TVs have ```deviceClasses: "tv,flatscreen"```. Which deviceClasses are mapped to WERTGARANTIE's insurances is up to you. 

Multiple deviceClasses can also be configured, seperated by Commas. 




## A word about performance
We're determined to keep file sizes as small as possible (we currently average <20kb). Nevertheless the component-loader, especially for ```selection-*``` components should only be included on products that are insurable. This prevents the end user from loading Javascript that's not needed.

Example: A Bike shop offers WERTGARANTIE insurances for Bikes and E-Bikes. The component-loader should therefore be included on bike and e-bike pages. Helmets are not insurable, the loader should therefore not be included on a helmet-detail-page.
